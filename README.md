# PSA API Specifications

This is the official place for the development the PSA API specifications.

This GitHub repository contains:
*  Specification source files
*  Reference copies of the PSA API header files
*  Examples of usage and implementation of the PSA APIs
*  Build tooling for rendering the specifications
*  Discussions of updates to the specifications
*  Proposed changes to the specifications

Officially released specification documents can be found at the [PSA API specifications website][PSA API website].

Note: The PSA APIs have previously been referred to as the PSA Certified APIs.

[PSA API website]: https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/

## Specifications

The following specifications are part of the PSA API.

Specification | Published | Document source | Reference headers
-|-|-|-
Crypto API | [1.5.0][crypto-specs] | [doc/crypto/] | [headers/crypto/1.5/]
Secure Storage API | [1.0.4][storage-specs] | [doc/storage/] |  [headers/storage/1.0/]
Attestation API | [2.0.0][attestation-specs] | [doc/attestation/] |  [headers/attestation/2.0/]
Firmware Update API | [1.0.1][fwu-specs] | [doc/fwu/] |  [headers/fwu/1.0/]
Status code API | [1.0.5][status-specs] | [doc/status-code/] |  [headers/status-code/1.0/]

[crypto-specs]:         https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/crypto/
[storage-specs]:        https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/storage/
[attestation-specs]:    https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/attestation/
[fwu-specs]:            https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/fwu/
[status-specs]:         https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/status-code/

[doc/crypto/]:          doc/crypto
[doc/storage/]:         doc/storage
[doc/attestation/]:     doc/attestation
[doc/fwu/]:             doc/fwu
[doc/status-code/]:     doc/status-code

[headers/crypto/1.5/]:      headers/crypto/1.5
[headers/storage/1.0/]:     headers/storage/1.0
[headers/attestation/2.0/]: headers/attestation/2.0
[headers/fwu/1.0/]:         headers/fwu/1.0
[headers/status-code/1.0/]: headers/status-code/1.0

### Extensions

Extension specifications introduce new functionality that is not yet stable enough for inclusion in the main specification.

API | Extension | Published | Document source | Reference headers
-|-|-|-|-
Crypto API | PAKE | [*Integrated in 1.3.0*][crypto-specs] | *n/a* | *n/a*
Crypto API | PQC | [*Integrated in 1.5*][crypto-specs] | *n/a* | *n/a*

### In development

The following specifications are being developed towards an initial 1.0 version:

Specification | Published | Document source | Reference headers
-|-|-|-
Crypto Driver Interface | [1.0 Alpha-1][crypto-driver-specs] | [doc/crypto-driver/] | *n/a*

[crypto-driver-specs]:  https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/crypto-driver/
[doc/crypto-driver/]:   doc/crypto-driver

## Reference header files

Reference header files for each minor version of each API are provided in the [headers/] folder.

[headers/]: headers

## Building the specifications

This repository includes the documentation build tooling in [tools/]. The top-level `Makefile` uses that local tool copy by default, so a normal build does not require a separate checkout of the build tools.

The HTML build requires Python 3.11 or later, Sphinx, and `make`. PDF output also requires a LaTeX toolchain with `pdflatex`. Regenerating figures can require additional tools, depending on the figure source format, including Graphviz, `wavedrompy`, PlantUML, Java, and `rsvg-convert`.

Build one specification from the repository root with:

```sh
make doc/crypto/html
make doc/crypto/pdf
make doc/crypto/headers
make doc/crypto/api-diff
```

Replace `doc/crypto` with another specification directory, such as `doc/attestation`, `doc/storage`, `doc/fwu`, `doc/status-code`, or `doc/crypto-driver`.

Build one output format for every specification with:

```sh
make html
make pdf
```

Generated output is written under the untracked **build/** folder. The build guide in [tools/docs/using-psa-api-tool.md] describes the available targets, dependencies, and validation flow. The editing reference in [tools/docs/psa-api-tool-notes.md] describes the custom directives, roles, and source conventions used by the specifications.

[tools/docs/psa-api-tool-notes.md]: tools/docs/psa-api-tool-notes.md

## Test Suite

Test suites are available to validate compliance of API implementations against the specifications for Crypto, Attestation, and Secure Storage APIs, from: [github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests].

Compliance badges can be obtained from [PSA Certified] to showcase compatible products.

[PSA Certified]: https://www.psacertified.org/getting-certified/functional-api-certification/

## Example source code

Source code examples of both usage, and implementation, of the PSA APIs are provided in the [examples/] folder.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license (both the CC BY-SA 4.0 Public License and this Patent License), each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### About the license

The language in the additional patent license is largely identical to that in section 3 of [Apache License, Version 2.0][APACHE-2.0] (Apache 2.0) with two exceptions:

1. Changes are made related to the defined terms, to align those defined terms with the terminology in CC BY-SA 4.0 rather than Apache 2.0 (for example, changing "Work" to "Licensed Material").

2. The scope of the defensive termination clause is changed from "any patent licenses granted to You" to "any licenses granted to You". This change is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing additional protection to the community against patent litigation claims.
